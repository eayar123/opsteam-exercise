###About The Project

In this exercise I was told to deploy an EFK stack on a kubernetes cluster, which in my case was a minikube single node cluster, without helm chart or an operator, which means only by simple manifest files.
After deploying the EFK I also deployed an nginx application and needed to collect its logs and visualize them in kibana.

It was fun and challenging and Im really happy to learn more.
